## Flexygo's technologies
Flexygo is engineered on the .NET core framework, providing a modern, cross-platform, and high-performance foundation. Its native compatibility with both SQL Server and Oracle databases offers significant architectural flexibility.

### Front End
When developing a Flexygo product front-end you'll be able to use Flexygo's own tools like prebuilt [modules](./Modules/Basic.md) and [components](./Components). Also you'll have acces to HTML, CSS, JS and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

### Back End
As Flexygo has been developed in .NET Core it does admit creating DLL process in C# or vb.net, and also admits stored procedures from SQL Server and Oracle as previously mentioned.

## Objects
No se muy bien que poner aquí, pero habría que explicar de forma hiper básica el concepto de objeto 🤔 🦦. BBBB

## Modules
Flexygo products are built using [modules](./Modules/basic.md) which are easy to configure components with lots of differents capabilities like showing [charts](./Modules/Chart.md), creaing a [Kanban](./Modules/Kanban.md), showing [maps](./Modules/Maps.md) with locations and [routes](./Modules/Maps.md#routes) and lots more.

## Creating Reports
Flexygo does also have the possibilty of creatintg your own [reports](./Reporting/Newsandversionnotes.md) in HTML, Power BI, DevExpress and Crystal Reports.

## Offline Application
Flexygo does also have the possibilty of creating an aside [mobile app](./Offline%20App/Creating%20your%20first%20app/0-UnderstandingOfflineApps.md) to be accessed offline allowing to continue working even in remote places with low connectivity. 

### Technologies
Flexygo's [Offline app](./Offline%20App/Creating%20your%20first%20app/0-UnderstandingOfflineApps.md) does use [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v4/components) at is base, with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs) and [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/). It also uses [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) as its way to store the data that will come in a synchronization with your Flexygo project.

### Development
Flexygo's [Offline app](./Offline%20App/Creating%20your%20first%20app/0-UnderstandingOfflineApps.md) product development requires of a bigger programming knowdledge as the pages must be built with HTML, CSS, JS and Ionic knowdlege.

### Tracking
Flexygo's [Offline app](./Offline%20App/Creating%20your%20first%20app/0-UnderstandingOfflineApps.md) has [tracking](./Offline%20App/1-Trackingconfiguration.md) functionality which allows getting the exact location data of the configured devices even when the app is closed. It can be configured to just track during ceratin periods of time.
