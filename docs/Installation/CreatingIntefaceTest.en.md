# Add an interface test

## Prerequisites

To be able to use Playwright, it is necessary to have Node.js, Visual Studio 2022 installed, and the website to be tested published at a URL. For this example, we will use: **http://localhost/Sample_Project**
{ .flx-warning-card }

## 1. Define the product name

Enter the product name here so that the names are automatically updated and you only have to copy and paste them:

<fh-namepropagator selector="propagated-projectname" placeholder="AhoraFlexy"></fh-namepropagator>

## 2. Add project

Add a new project <fh-copy><span class="propagated-projectname"></span>InterfaceTest</fh-copy>

## 3. Open test recorder

Open a PowerShell window by right-clicking on your project > **Open in Terminal**

Run the following command to open the test recorder.
*If this is the first time you run it, you will get a permissions error and you will need to previously run the command <fh-copy>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</fh-copy>*

```powershell
./bin/Debug/net6.0/playwright.ps1 codegen http://localhost/Sample_Project
```
