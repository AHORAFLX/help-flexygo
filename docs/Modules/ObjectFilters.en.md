# Object Filters

Search filters are a tool to help us find information efficiently. They are instruments whose aim is to reduce the negative effect caused by the excess of information in databases, to minimize unnecessary or redundant information, as well asraising the level of specifcity or sensitivity of the search as much possible. By default, when you install **flexygo** each of the existing objects has two types of filter: A **properties** type and **text** filter type. It’s also posible to create as many new filters as we like for any kind of object.

## How to set up a search filter

To create a new search filter, you must access the collection list of results. Once you have accessed the list of results, on the top from list there're various icons. The last icon provides the **management of filters.** To generate a new filter properly, the first step is to assign a name, the second select the type of search (properties or text) from the dropdown menú and finally, indicate the properties that we want to use as search options.

Here is an example of creating search filter in property mode.

## Search modification

It is also possible to modify the search name, add or delete properties. Therefore, clicking on the filters icon and after on "settings", we will access the corresponding filter management window. It is important to indicate in the first drop-down the search that you want to edit. From this screen user may carry out the generation of new searches, the modification of names, add properties and delete properties.

## Property filters

In the following screenshots, you can see the number of récords returned by the search. First of all, you can see (Image 4) uses the surname as search property and it returns a number of results. Secondly, in the following screenshot (Image 5), we include the “last name“ and “Name”, this entails a change in the number of results returned. Finally, say that, search filters can be performed with multiple properties simultaneously.

## Text filters

**Text** filter work in the same way only that we sahll only have a text box showing the fields that will perform the search usink a like condition, all at the same time. In the following image (Image 7) you can see that, from a written text it will try an find "like" matches in all the indicate search columns.
